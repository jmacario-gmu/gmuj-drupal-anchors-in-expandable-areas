# HTML Anchors in Expandable Areas Functionality

**This JavaScript/jQuery script provides functionality in cases where an HTML anchor tags on a webpage is situated within an expandable content area which is closed by default.**

**This script is intended for use on Mason Drupal Platform websites, but may also work with minor modification on other websites.** 

## The Problem

When a link is provided to an HTML anchor within a page, if the HTML anchor tag is situated within an expandable content area which defaults to closed, the browser doesnâ€™t automatically move to the anchor, nor is there is an automatic mechanism to open the relevant expandable area.

## The Solution

This script performs the following procedure:

1. Check for the presence of a named anchor in the URL.
2. If an anchor is found in the URL, check for a corresponding named anchor within the web page.
3. If a corresponding named anchor is found within the web page, identify and opens the expandable content area containing the anchor, if any.
4. Scroll to the location of the anchor (minus a few pixels to account for the menu bar).
